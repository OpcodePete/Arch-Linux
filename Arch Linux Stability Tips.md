# Arch Linux Stability Tips

The following tips have helped me to have a rock-solid Arch Linux machine.

1. Use the LTS kernal

   

2. Have 'good' backups:

   1. System point-in-time backups
   2. Home folder backups
   3. Image backup of main disk (i.e. last resort) - dd and Clonezilla.

   

3. Do not update daily - weekly is a good frequency (esp. when you have spare time in the weekend).

   

4. Regularly check Arch Linux updates news via the Arch Linux home page, the mailing list, or the rss feed.

   

5. Do not install obsolete AUR packages 

   

6. Use LVM Snapshot before a large update
